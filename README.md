This plugin makes dealing with cookies easy.  Provides an injectable service and tag to easily get, set, and delete cookies with one line.

## Installation

To install the cookie plug-in just add to BuildConfig.groovy:

```
compile ':cookie:0.5'
```

Or install via command line:

```
grails install-plugin cookie
```

## Configuration

You can configure how long the default cookie age will be (in seconds) when not explicitly supplied while setting a cookie.

```
grails.plugins.cookie.cookieage.default = 86400 // if not specified default in code is 30 days
```
## Usage

The cookie plug-in extends the request and response objects found in controllers, filters, etc to allow the following:

Example of setting a new cookie: (this sets a cookie with the name 'username' to the value 'cookieUser123' with a expiration set to a week, defined in seconds)

```
response.setCookie('username', 'cookieUser123', 604800)
```

OR

```
response.setCookie('username', 'cookieUser123') // will use default age in Config (or 30 days if not defined)
```

To get the cookie value:

```
request.getCookie('username') // returns 'cookieUser123'
```

To delete the cookie:

```
response.deleteCookie('username') // deletes the 'username' cookie
```

## Usage by calling CookieService directly

The cookie plug-in provides a CookieService that can be used anywhere in your Grails application.

To use CookieService, declare a dependency injection:

```
def cookieService
```

Setting a new cookie:

```
cookieService.setCookie('username', 'cookieUser123', 604800)
```

OR

```
cookieService.setCookie('username', 'cookieUser123')// will use default age in Config (or 30 days if not defined)
```

Getting the cookie value:

```
cookieService.get('username') // returns 'cookieUser123'
```

Deleting the cookie:

```
cookieService.delete('username') // deletes the 'username' cookie
```

## Tag Lib (deprecated)

You can also get a cookie value with a tag:

```
<cookie:get name='username' />
```

Note: Since 0.5 this tag is deprecated and will be removed in next releases. Use <g:cookie/> tag instead.

## Notes

In the 0.3 release a big issue was fixed that now sets the cookie's path to the root '/' context.
Otherwise it was setting the path to the same as the controller/service that triggered it.
Most users I believe will want this behavior.  If setting the path is desired, that can be accomodated.
Please contact me or do a pull request if you'd like that.
